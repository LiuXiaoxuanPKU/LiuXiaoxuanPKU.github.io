## About Me

Hi, I am Xiaoxuan. I am a second-year CS PhD student from UC Berkeley. I am fortunately advised by Professor [Alvin Cheung](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~akcheung/). I got my master from CMU, working with amazing [Andy](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/) and [Huanchen](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~huanche1/). I did my undergraduate in PKU.
